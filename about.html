    <h2>About the World Map of Microinsurance</h2>
    <p>Based on the 3 latest regional landscapes (Africa - 2015; LAC - 2014; Asia – 2013), total self-reported coverage of microinsurance in three major microinsurance regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America stands at <strong>280.8 Million</strong> lives and properties which (based on self-reported data) generated microinsurance premiums worth USD 2.4 billion.</p>

    <h4><strong>What is the World Map of Microinsurance?</strong></h4>
    <p>The World Map of Microinsurance (WMM) is a dynamic platform providing key global data
      on microinsurance. The map enables insurers and microinsurance practitioners to gain a birds
      eye view on the landscape of microinsurance worldwide, and to search and extract sector-
      specific data by region to gain insights into trends in microinsurance, fostering better decision
      making at an operational and policy level. The map <strong>hosts data</strong> and analysis from tri-annual
      regional <strong>landscape studies</strong>. Further, periodic posts on relevant issues and best/innovative
      practices in microinsurance will be released on the platform on a regular basis.</p>
    <h4><strong>The history of Landscape studies</strong></h4>
    <p>The pursuit for understanding the microinsurance sector through the lens of data started with the Landmark study, <a href="http://www.microinsurancecentre.org/resources/documents/unknown/the-landscape-of-microinsurance-in-the-worlds-100-poorest-countries-in-english.html" target="_blank">"The Landscape of Microinsurance in the World’s 100 Poorest Countries"</a>, published in 2006. This was followed by the following landscape studies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Africa 2010</strong> (<a href="http://www.microinsurancenetwork.org//sites/default/files/files/mpaper4_landscape_en.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>)</li>
      <li><strong>Latin America and the Caribbean 2011</strong> (<a href="http://www.microinsurancenetwork.org/groups/landscape-microinsurance-latin-america-and-caribbean-0" target="_blank">web</a>)</li>
      <li><strong>Africa 2012</strong> (<a href="http://www.microinsurancenetwork.org/groups/landscape-microinsurance-africa-2012" target="_blank">web</a>)</li>
      <li><strong>Asia and Oceania 2013</strong> (<a href="http://www.microinsurancenetwork.org/groups/landscape-microinsurance-asia-and-oceania-2013" target="_blank">web</a>)</li>
      <li><strong>Latin America and the Caribbean 2014</strong> (<a href="http://www.microinsurancenetwork.org/groups/landscape-microinsurance-latin-america-and-caribbean-2014" target="_blank">web</a>) </li>
      <li><strong>Africa 2015</strong> (<a href="http://www.microinsurancenetwork.org/groups/landscape-microinsurance-africa-2015" target="_blank">web</a>) </li>
      <li><strong>Asia 2016</strong> (<a href="http://www.microinsurancenetwork.org/groups/insights-mobile-network-operators-distribution-channel-microinsurance-asia" target="_blank">web</a>). In 2016 the study was reduced in scope and focused on Microinsurance provided through MNOs in Asia and Sri Lanka (<a href="http://www.microinsurancenetwork.org/groups/landscape-microinsurance-sri-lanka" target="_blank">web</a>) (Note: only the Sri Lanka study data has been added to the WMM. The MNO study will be added by February 2017).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These studies provide an overview of the microinsurance market in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
    <p>These landscape studies have been led by the <a href="http://www.munichre-foundation.org" target="_blank">Munich Re Foundation </a> and the Microinsurance Network in collaboration with and support from the ILO’s <a href="http://www.microinsurancefacility.org/" target="_blank">Impact Insurance Facility</a>, the <a href="http://www.iadb.org/en/inter-american-development-bank,2837.html" target="_blank">Inter-American Development Bank</a>, the <a href="http://www.afdb.org" target="_blank">African Development Bank</a>, the <a href="http://www.adb.org" target="_blank">Asian Development Bank</a>, and <a href="http://www.mfw4a.org" target="_blank">Making Finance Work for Africa </a> (MFW4A), <a href="http://www.giz.de/en" target="_blank">GIZ</a> on behalf of <a href="http://www.bmz.de/" target="_blank">BMZ</a>. This pioneering research has been carried out by the <a href="http://www.microinsurancecentre.org" target="_blank">MicroInsurance Centre</a> (Landscape study of 100 poorest countries, 2006, Latin America, 2011 and 2014, and Africa, 2012 and 2015), <a href="http://www.microsave.net/" target="_blank">MicroSave</a> (Asia, 2013), and <a href="http://www.basix-consulting.com/" target="_blank">Basix Consulting</a> (Asia MNO study and Sri lanka 2016).</p>
    <p>To ensure a long-term follow up and continued access to microinsurance data, the
      Microinsurance Network has now institutionalised and expanded upon these efforts through the
      creation of the World Map of Microinsurance (WMM) programme.</p>
    <h4><strong>Why do we need it?</strong></h4>
    <p>Insurance is a data-driven industry, and the World Map of Microinsurance will enable the sector to develop effectively, producing more valuable products for clients while improving profitability for insurers.  As microinsurance is an emerging industry, there is not sufficient data to create field-wide benchmarks on which to assess performance. Data is critical to the advancement of microinsurance, as it generates market knowledge, facilitates market development, furthers best practices and can lead to better products and services. On a global level, data can identify factors that detract from or drive development. Country-level data is essential to effective pricing, insurers’ ability to understand the low-income market, and the development of quantitative goals and benchmarks. On a company-level basis, improving insurers’ knowledge of the low-income market is mutually beneficial for both the insurer and the client: Clients gain access to products which better meet their needs, and insurers can expand their client base.</p>
    <h4><strong>What will it achieve?</strong></h4>
    <p>Ultimately, we want the WMM to advance microinsurance as a tool that can effectively protect low income populations in developing countries against the crises that push them into and trap them into poverty.</p>
    <p>This can be achieved, first and foremost, <strong>by providing insurers with the knowledge they need</strong> to create more valuable and effective products. By gaining a better understanding of the low income market and the specific needs of the clients they serve, firms can design products which meet the needs of their client-base at a price that is efficient. The tractability of the data will allow firms to gain important information about the market they work in, and subsequently will empower them to grow their business, reaching even more low-income clients.</p>
    <p>Having data on microinsurance converge in one location creates a space for further
      knowledge generation, collaboration, and learning, creating a collective authority to help gain
      respect and recognition for the industry, and advance its status as an important tool for
      development worldwide.</p>
